    "description": "Originally built in 1926 as the headquarters for the Benevolent & Protective Order of the Elks, the theater features a limestone and terra cotta facade, with Renaissance-revival style features including balustrades, egg-and- dart ornamentation, Corinthian columns, and 40-foot vaulted ceilings. This McKim, Mead & White designed 4,800 square foot theater space provides unique acoustics. In 2008, ISSUE was awarded a long-term lease on a theater space in the historic 110 Livingston Street building in Downtown Brooklyn. Offering a centralized location and an audience capacity more than double that of any previous space ISSUE had occupied, the new theater has helped facilitate a degree of publicity and awareness unique for our community of under-recognized artists.",

Architect John Welch was commissioned to design the church after a fire in 1887 destroyed much of the structure. Welch drew inspiration from churches built during the Italian Renaissance, particularly those in Modena and Verona. Many of the windows were commissioned for the church from the Tiffany Studio. The wheel or rose window was given by the children of the Sunday school at the time of the rebuilding in 1890. It is 28 feet in diameter and is one of the larger windows of this type in Brooklyn. In 1981 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew as a landmark.<br><br>Funded through a NYCDEP Green Infrastructure Grant, the new green infrastructure network for the Church captures, stores, and recycles on-site stormwater to protect the foundation of the historic building from flooding, while sustaining new public gardens and walkways.\"",

The Niblo Mausoleum is undoubtedly one of the prettiest sights at Green-Wood. But the Niblo Mausoleum was once host to one of the most scandalous parties in Brooklyn.<br><br>William Niblo was a theater impresario, the owner of Niblo\u2019s Garden, a \u201cpleasure theater\u201d that opened in 1828 at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street in Manhattan. The Garden would feature dancers, fireworks, music, and more. As a prominent New Yorker, Niblo purchased and built his mausoleum at Green-Wood well before his earthly demise in 1878. Recognizing its potential as an event space, he would throw wild parties on the lawn of the mausoleum, much to the chagrin of the cemetery management at the time. Today, Green-Wood has embraced Niblo\u2019s legacy and thrown their own parties inspired by Niblo\u2019s Garden.",

    "description": "It\u2019s hard to miss the Van Ness Parsons mausoleum at Green-Wood Cemetery because the mausoleum is a legitimate pyramid. Though the Egyptian influence was a big part of Art Deco design in the early 1900s, the Van Ness Parsons mausoleum is a fascinating hybrid of Egyptian Revival and Christian symbolism. Greeting you at the front of the pyramid, you\u2019ll see Jesus Christ, holding a lamb, and the Virgin Mary, holding the infant version of Jesus just next to him. There\u2019s another female figure to the left, probably Pharaoh\u2019s wife discovering baby Moses. But just adjacent to Mary is a friendly sphinx, and there are Egyptian vulture wings that adorn the mausoleum\u2019s doorframe. It\u2019s a beautifully bizarre convergence of cultures.<br><br>The mausoleum belongs to Alfred Ross Parsons, a celebrated pianist and music teacher who died in 1933. Parsons was also an Egyptologist and author of New Light from the Great Pyramid, on the geographical discoveries of the Egyptians. So it\u2019s unsurprising that Parsons rests in a literal pyramid, alongside his wife, Alice Schuyler Van Ness, who predeceased him in 1931.",

    "description": "Debutante Charlotte Canda was coming home from her \u201ccoming out\u201d party on the evening of her seventeenth birthday in 1845 when the horse pulling her carriage down Fifth Avenue was spooked by a thunderclap. Charlotte was thrown from the carriage and died in her father\u2019s arms. She had been hard at work on designs for the tomb of her aunt, who had recently died. Those designs went into her own grave as Charlotte\u2019s grieving father immediately began plans for an elaborate memorial to his daughter at Green-Wood.<br><br>The resulting tomb became one of Green-Wood\u2019s most popular tourist attractions once it was completed in 1848. By the 1860s, people knew \u201cMiss Canda\u201d from poems and songs about her grave at Green-Wood. The gorgeous, Gothic style memorial is filled with symbolism: it is seventeen feet wide and seventeen feet long, for each year of Charlotte\u2019s brief life. A statue of Charlotte stands underneath a canopy of stars, decorated with roses, which symbolize the loss of a young woman. Charlotte\u2019s fiance, a young man named Charles Albert Jarrett de la Marie, consumed with grief, committed suicide a year after her death. At the time, suicides weren\u2019t allowed to be buried in consecrated ground, so he rests just adjacent to Charlotte\u2019s epic memorial at Green-Wood.",

    "description": "In 2007, as part of a PlaNYC initiative to create regional destination parks in all five boroughs, the comprehensive master plan design for the 72-acre Calvert Vaux Park was unveiled. Central to this plan was the construction of a Park Pavilion and Maintenance Facility, designed by 1100 Architect. The concept was developed based on the requirement that five distinct programs (athletic storage, public restroom, staff office, work area, and vehicle storage) be located within one site.<br><br>One of the design challenges was to build a single facility that worked both as a hospitable environment for park visitors, but also as a durable facility for the heavy use of park vehicles and maintenance equipment. To cohesively serve those two very different user groups, the design creates an innovative footprint that merges three connected wings. The building doubles as a gateway to the park, providing a sense of arrival. On track for LEED Silver Certification, the design also includes an array of measures for sustainability and energy efficiency.",
